# Mantalon-Portal

Mantalon-Portal is a tool enabling the creation of live copies of any target website, with the ability to inject custom scripts, styles, and more, in a webextension-like fashion.

Portals rely internally on the mantalon server and client, but don't run any backend code themselves. They can be served as static files, and can be configured solely with a JSON file referencing scripts and assets to inject.
